## Benefits
- Hassle free coding
- Increase efficiency
- Easy image editing

## Getting Started
To start with this, we need to simply add the dependencies from `mavenCentral()` in the gradle file of our app module like this
```groovy
implementation 'com.burhanrashid52:photoeditor:3.0.1'
```
or we can also import the :photoeditor module from sample for further customization

## Migrations
### AndroidX
PhotoEditor [v.1.0.0](https://github.com/burhanrashid52/PhotoEditor/releases/tag/v.1.0.0) is a migration to androidX and dropping the support of older support library. There are no API changes. If you find any issue migrating to v.1.0.0 , please follow this [Guide](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/migrate). If you still facing the issue than you can always rollback to [v.0.4.0](https://github.com/burhanrashid52/PhotoEditor/releases/tag/v.0.4.0). Any fix in PR are Welcome :)

### Kotlin
PhotoEditor [v.2.0.0](https://github.com/burhanrashid52/PhotoEditor/releases/tag/v.2.0.0) is fully migrated to Kotlin. You can use [v.1.5.1](https://github.com/burhanrashid52/PhotoEditor/releases/tag/v.1.5.1) for the Java version. There are no breaking API changes in these two versions.

## Setting up the View
First we need to add `PhotoEditorView` in our xml layout

```xml
 <ja.burhanrashid52.photoeditor.PhotoEditorView
        android:id="@+id/photoEditorView"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="match_parent"
        app:photo_src="@drawable/got_s" />
  
```
We can define our drawable or color resource directly using `app:photo_src`

We can set the image programmatically by getting source from `PhotoEditorView` which will return a `ImageView` so that we can load image from resources,file or (Picasso/Glide)
```java
PhotoEditorView mPhotoEditorView = findViewById(R.id.photoEditorView);

mPhotoEditorView.getSource().setImageResource(R.drawable.got);
```

## Building a PhotoEditor
To use the image editing feature we need to build a PhotoEditor which requires a Context and PhotoEditorView which we have to setup in our xml layout


```java
//Use custom font using latest support library
Typeface mTextRobotoTf = ResourcesCompat.getFont(this, R.font.roboto_medium);

//loading font from asset
Typeface mEmojiTypeFace = Typeface.createFromAsset(getAssets(), "emojione-android.ttf");

mPhotoEditor = new PhotoEditor.Builder(this, mPhotoEditorView)
         .setPinchTextScalable(true)
         .setClipSourceImage(true)
         .setDefaultTextTypeface(mTextRobotoTf)
         .setDefaultEmojiTypeface(mEmojiTypeFace)
         .build();
 ```
We can customize the properties in the PhotoEditor as per our requirement

| Property  | Usage |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| `setPinchTextScalable()`  | set false to disable pinch to zoom on text insertion. Default: true. |
| `setClipSourceImage()` | set true to clip the drawing brush to the source image. Default: false. |
| `setDefaultTextTypeface()`  | set default text font to be added on image  |
| `setDefaultEmojiTypeface()`  | set default font specifc to add emojis |

That's it we are done with setting up our library



## Drawing
We can customize our brush and paint with different set of property. To start drawing on image we need to enable the drawing mode

![](https://i.imgur.com/INi5LIy.gif)

| Type                                         | Method                                                                 |
|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Enable/Disable                               | `mPhotoEditor.setBrushDrawingMode(true);`                              |
| Shape (brush, line, oval, rectangle, arrow)  | `mPhotoEditor.addShape(shape)`                                         |
| Shape size (px)                              | `mPhotoEditor.setBrushSize(brushSize)` or through the a ShapeBuilder   |
| Shape opacity (In %)                         | `mPhotoEditor.setOpacity(opacity)` or through the a ShapeBuilder       |
| Shape color                                  | `mPhotoEditor.setBrushColor(colorCode)` or through the a ShapeBuilder  |
| Brush Eraser                                 | `mPhotoEditor.brushEraser()`                                           |

**Note**: Whenever we set any property of a brush for drawing it will automatically enable the drawing mode

## Shapes
We can draw shapes from [v.1.5.0](https://github.com/burhanrashid52/PhotoEditor/releases/tag/v.1.5.0). We use `ShapeBuilder` to define shape and other properties.

![](https://im2.ezgif.com/tmp/ezgif-2-5d5f7ddbe72e.gif)

```kotlin
val shapeBuilder = ShapeBuilder()
    .withShapeOpacity(100)
    .withShapeType(ShapeType.Oval)
    .withShapeSize(50f);

photoEditor.setShape(mShapeBuilder)
```
For more details check [ShapeBuilder](https://github.com/burhanrashid52/PhotoEditor/blob/master/photoeditor/src/main/java/ja/burhanrashid52/photoeditor/shape/ShapeBuilder.kt).

## Filter Effect
We can apply inbuild filter to the source images using 

 `mPhotoEditor.setFilterEffect(PhotoFilter.BRIGHTNESS);`

![](https://i.imgur.com/xXTGcVC.gif)

We can also apply custom effect using `Custom.Builder`

For more details check [Custom Filters](https://github.com/burhanrashid52/PhotoEditor/wiki/Filter-Effect)



## Text

![](https://i.imgur.com/491BmE8.gif)

We can add the text with inputText and colorCode like this

`mPhotoEditor.addText(inputText, colorCode);` 

It will take default fonts provided in the builder. If we want different fonts for different text we can set typeface with each text like this

`mPhotoEditor.addText(mTypeface,inputText, colorCode);`

In order to edit the text we need the view, which we will receive in our PhotoEditor callback. This callback will trigger when we **Long Press** the added text

 ```java
 mPhotoEditor.setOnPhotoEditorListener(new OnPhotoEditorListener() {
            @Override
            public void onEditTextChangeListener(View rootView, String text, int colorCode) {
                
            }
        });
  ```
Now we can edit the text with a view like this

`mPhotoEditor.editText(rootView, inputText, colorCode);`

If you want more customization on text. Please refer the wiki page for more details.


## Emoji

![](https://i.imgur.com/RP8kqz6.gif)

We can add the Emoji by `PhotoEditor.getEmojis(getActivity());` which will return a list of emojis unicode.

`mPhotoEditor.addEmoji(emojiUnicode);`

It will take default fonts provided in the builder. If we want different Emoji fonts for different emoji we can set typeface with each Emoji like this

`mPhotoEditor.addEmoji(mEmojiTypeface,emojiUnicode);`




## Adding Images/Stickers
 We need to provide a Bitmap to add our Images  `mPhotoEditor.addImage(bitmap);`
 
 
 

## Undo and Redo

![](https://i.imgur.com/1Y9WcCB.gif)

 ```java
   mPhotoEditor.undo();
   mPhotoEditor.redo();
 ```
 


## Deleting
  For deleting a Text/Emoji/Image we can click on the view to toggle the view highlighter box which will have a close icon. So, by clicking on the icon we can delete the view.

## Saving

In [v.3.0.0](https://github.com/burhanrashid52/PhotoEditor/releases/tag/v.3.0.0) onward, we can save an image to a file using coroutines:

```kotlin
// Please note that if you call this from a fragment, you should call
// 'viewLifecycleOwner.lifecycleScope.launch' instead.
lifecycleScope.launch {
    val result = photoEditor.saveAsFile(filePath)
    if (result is SaveFileResult.Success) {
        showSnackbar("Image saved!")
    } else {
        showSnackbar("Couldn't save image")
    }
}
```

You can also save an image to a file from Java. We need to provide a file with callback method when edited image is saved.

   ```java
    mPhotoEditor.saveAsFile(filePath, new PhotoEditor.OnSaveListener() {
                    @Override
                    public void onSuccess(@NonNull String imagePath) {
                       Log.e("PhotoEditor","Image Saved Successfully");
                    }

                    @Override
                    public void onFailure(@NonNull Exception exception) {
                        Log.e("PhotoEditor","Failed to save Image");
                    }
                });
```
